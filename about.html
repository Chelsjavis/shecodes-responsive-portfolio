      <div class="biography">
        <p>
          Chelsea Davis is a flautist and piccoloist who is passionate about
          performing music by under-represented composers, something which is
          reflected in her research interests. <br /><br />Based in Perth,
          Chelsea has a First-Class Honours degree in performance from the
          University of Western Australia. She is currently completing her
          Masters of Music (Orchestral Performance), studying with Andrew
          Nicholson, Principal Flute of the West Australian Symphony Orchestra.
          Her research project focuses on promoting the programming of diverse
          repertoire in undergraduate recitals, and her recent Master’s recital
          explored works for flute and piano written by women. <br /><br />
          Chelsea enjoys being a part of the Perth music community; she is a
          casual musician with WASO, Principal Flute of the West Coast
          Philharmonic Orchestra, and regularly performs with ensembles such as
          the West Australian Wind Symphony, the Orchestra Collective and South
          Perth Chamber Orchestra. She is also an avid choral singer, and
          currently sings with the Chapel Choir of St George’s College.
